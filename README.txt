3D Programming in Java

This course covers a range of 3D techniques to create a range of 3D applications in Java. Topics include loading externally produced 3D models, making 3D lathe shapes, coding 3D interaction, developing 3D animation, enhancing lights and shades for 3D objects, overlaying textures on objects, and 3D sprites.

The code for these programs was developed in BlueJ using Java/Java3D. There are 2 assignments (TMEs) and a final project.

TME 1

	My first foray into 3D programming. I created a couple scenes and answered a few questions. See the .pdf for details.
	Questions 1, 2 and 6 are programs available in separate folders.

TME 2

	As I continued to learn 3D concepts, I created more advanced 3D scenes. I also answered some more advanced questions. See the .pdf for details.
	Questions 2, 3, 5, and 8 are programs available in separate folders.

Final Project

	This project implements a Java3D scene in various stages. See the file for details. Each stage can be found in its own folder as a separate program.
